# Introduction

Hi! My name is Hristo. This is a collection of my notes (typed and drawn) on SoftUni's course in Artificial Intelligence. The course had four parts: Math and Statistics, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.

There are undoubtedly inaccuracies, the formatting is also not always pretty. However, I created the book mainly for myself, as a way to combine all information in one document and easily access it . Below is also a list of my projects so far.

## Projects
Longer, with more research, but older. Done as final-course assignments.

````{card} Sumo Bouts Prediction

```
My ML project - predicting the outcome of a sumo match. In part 1, I explore, preprocess the data, and engineer new features. In part 2, I fit, tune-up, and evaluate various models.

[part 2](https://github.com/hrstnikolov/machine-learning-2022/blob/main/99%20Sumo/Sumo%20Bouts%20Prediction%202.ipynb)

````{card} Predictive Maintenance
```{figure} icons8-subway-100.png

```
My data science project - pre-process the data, look for patterns, make hypothesis and test them.
Investigation of 2 dataset: 1) machining parts 2) failures on the air production unit of metro trains in Porto, Portugal.
[part 1](https://github.com/hrstnikolov/data-science/blob/main/Final%20Project%20-%20Predictive%20Maintenance/Predictive%20Maintenance%20(part%201).ipynb)
[part 2](https://github.com/hrstnikolov/data-science/blob/main/Final%20Project%20-%20Predictive%20Maintenance/Predictive%20Maintenance%20(part%202).ipynb)
````

````{card} Principal Component Analysis
```{figure} icons8-math-book-100.png
---
align: left
```
My maths project - investigating the maths behind Principal Component Analysis (PCA), including Singular Values Decomposition (SVD). It also apply it to the eigenfaces problem.

## Mini-projects
Shorter and succinct, but more recent.
